# Ark UI Components — Styled with Panda CSS

This project demonstrates how to style component from Ark UI using Panda CSS.
We take full advantage of Ark UI's headless structure and Panda’s slot recipe system to build a clean, scalable, and flexible component using design tokens and variants.

## What This Project Covers

- How to render the Ark UI component

- How to target each component part (root, image, fallback)

- Using Panda CSS tokens for consistent, theme-based styling

- "Thinking in recipes" to define base styles and variants in one place

- Implementing base styles, size variants, shape variants, and visual variants using Panda's recipe system
